## NEON Woody Carbon

- Each site has a set of plots (either "tower" or "distributed")
- Each tree is mapped (species)
- Each year, each tree is measured: live or dead, diameter

## NEON Woody Carbon

- Diameter can be converted to biomass using "allometric" relationships
- Biomass can be converted to carbon (biomass x 2)
- Allometric relationships are from Jenkin et al. 2004

## NEON Woody Carbon

- Carbon for individual trees is summed within a plot to determine the plot carbon each year
- The summed carbon is divided by the area (m^2) of the plot to standardize across plots of different size
- All plots within a site averaged to get a site-level carbon for each year.

## Structure of data

- Data is spread across multiple tables
- The data are stored in a relationship database.

## New skills

- Reading in database in R
- Joining tables to create data frames for analysis
